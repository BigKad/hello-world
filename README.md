Hi Nerds

My name is BigKyle. I am just a fat black man from belize who at the age of 24 is just coming into his own. I love visuals I want to be
hence why I aim to be an awesome developer, photographer, and graphic designer. Its only been a short time doing all these things but I have come a long way. So only time will tell how awesome I am going to be.
